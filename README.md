## horsey-go-brrrr-be
Backend for 4th-semester DHBW Web technologies project 'horsey-go-brrrr'. <br>
Initially, this was planned to be a multiplayer chess app. Due to the unfortunate reality of the development team being halved, it has been scaled down to a 4-in-a-row game.
Nevertheless, the name shall remain as a glorious tribute to those whomst have fallen, for they shall never be forgotten.


## Local setup
- Java 21
- Maven 3.8

```bash
./mvnw quarkus:dev # keep in mind this currently does not work because the .mvn folder didn't make it to github - use correctly versioned mvn instead
```
