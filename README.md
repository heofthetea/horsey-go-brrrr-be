# horsey-go-brrrr-be

Backend for 4th-semester DHBW Web technologies project 'horsey-go-brrrr'. <br>
Initially, this was planned to be a multiplayer chess app. Due to the unfortunate reality of the development team being halved, it has been scaled down to a 4-in-a-row game.
Nevertheless, the name shall remain as a glorious tribute to those whomst have fallen, for they shall never be forgotten.

### Tech Stack
- Quarkus
- Java 21
- Build Tool: Maven

## Local setup

First, start the postgresql docker container by running the provided docker compose file.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

- Requirements:
  - Java 21
  - Maven 3.8

```bash
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```

## Docker Build
```bash
./mvnw clean package  -DskipTests
docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.jvm -t heofthetea/horsey-go-brrrr-be:jvm-latest .
```

A readily built image is available on docker hub under [heofthetea/horsey-go-brrrr-be:jvm-latest](hub.docker.com/repository/docker/heofthetea/horsey-go-brrrr-be).<br>

## Repository tour
All source Code is located in `src/main`.<br>
There are some unit tests for operations on JEN strings under `src/test/java`<br>
The configuration happens in `application.yml`, located in `src/main/resources`.

### Main java code
The following is the file tree of the main java source code. <br>
The project follows a controller-service-ORM structure. Controllers configure REST endpoints, while Service classes
handle business logic and communication to the database through Hibernate and JPA ORMs.
